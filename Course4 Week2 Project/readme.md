# README


I chose to do RRT. 
The only input requires to run RRT.py is the obstacles.csv file. 

I chose the recommended uniform random distribution to keep things simple. There are several minor levers to pull: max_interation, max_nodes_count, small distance length, tolerance for success criteria. These are all chosen for short run time, and nice simulation output.
